# AirQuoteDatabase
### Implemented a database and created an app using C++. The database provides some general SQL queries function and is able to handle big data input.

First, I wrote a set of test cases that can be used to help test implementation of a particular database API. 

Second, I created a standalone “library” that implements that database API, and that meet the functionality described in the test cases. 

Finally, I implemented a basic database application program that makes use of a database implementation provided by a different team.
